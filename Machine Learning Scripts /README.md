This folder contains many machine-learning methods and approaches to make simple meaningful predictions of Stopck prices using multiple technical indicators. I wish to expand it to include all methods from basic regression to the more complex model up to the point where I build an NLP model to parse through the quarter realeses and other rnews. 

Methods already implemented:

1. Regression

2. FB Prophet 
<br />
<br />
These are the predictions for the next 50 days. It predicts that the value of AZPN in 50 days will be in between 138 - 118 dollars a share (pretty bold).

3. LSTM based RNN model
<br />

Methods that I am working on :
1. Random Forest Classifier
2. Q-learning to simple make a simple choice - Buy, Sell or Hold.
3. KNN 


Methods I wish to implement: 
1. RNN
2. NLP parser to pick up indicators
3. Deep learning
