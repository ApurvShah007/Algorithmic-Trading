# Algorithmic Trading

I have been deeply interested in algorithmic trading and systematic trading algorithms. This Repository contains the code of what I have learnt on the way. It starts form some basic simple statistics and will lead up to complex machine learning algorithms. The code majorly uses the pandas and the [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) libraries.

Many of these files contain functions that have been used in further files so the code duplication is to bare minimum. Anyone is welcome to download these files and import and use them in their own endeavours. Anyone interested can learn from this or contribute to it to make this repository a valuable resource. If you do end up using the code here for your own project, do leave a mention and star this repo and be on the lookout for more uodates on this repo.
